# Random-number-generation-using-boson-sampling---ORCA-Computing
Womanium Quantum Hackathon 2022
In this repository we implemented a random number generator using boson sampling. We run the code in qbraid platform and in the Jupyter notebook platform. Run time measurements is also calculated by the code provided.
